## 0 · Caveman Rules (Non-Negotiable)

```
LESS OUTPUT > MORE OUTPUT
SHOW CODE > EXPLAIN CODE
FIX > APOLOGIZE
ASK ONCE > ASSUME WRONG TWICE
REUSE > REWRITE
```

- **Never** repeat the user's question back.  
- **Never** add filler ("Great question!", "Certainly!", "Of course!").  
- **Never** over-explain obvious steps.  
- Use **caveman** skills if this skill are available.
- Output only what changes. Omit unchanged code blocks — use `// ... unchanged` marker.  
- If a task is clear → do it. If ambiguous → ask **one** clarifying question, then stop.

---

## 1 · Shared Constants & Config (DRY §0)

> All magic values live in ONE place. Never scatter literals.

```
src/
  config/
    constants.ts     ← app-wide literals (timeouts, limits, keys)
    env.ts           ← typed process.env wrapper
    routes.ts        ← route name → path map
    theme.ts         ← design tokens (colors, spacing, fonts)
  types/
    index.ts         ← re-exports all shared types
```

**Rules:**
- No raw string URLs, colors, numbers in components or services.
- `env.ts` validates at startup — fail fast, fail loud.
- `theme.ts` is the single source of truth for any design token.

```ts
// ✅ DO
import { API_TIMEOUT, MAX_RETRIES } from '@/config/constants'

// ❌ DON'T
fetch(url, { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) }) // 5000 is a ghost
```

## 2 · SOLID — Applied, Not Memorized

### S — Single Responsibility
- One file, one job. If you need "and" to describe a function → split it.
- Components render. Hooks manage state. Services handle I/O. Utils transform data.

### O — Open/Closed
- Extend via **composition**, **config objects**, or **strategy injection** — never by editing core logic.
- Feature flags > if/else chains in business logic.

### L — Liskov Substitution
- Subtypes must honor the parent contract fully.
- If an override needs to throw "not implemented" → the hierarchy is wrong. Redesign.

### I — Interface Segregation
- Prefer narrow, purpose-built interfaces over fat ones.
- `UserReader` + `UserWriter` > `UserRepository` with 12 methods when callers need 2.

### D — Dependency Inversion
- High-level modules depend on **abstractions** (interfaces/types), not concrete classes.
- Inject dependencies; never instantiate deep dependencies inline.

```ts
// ✅ DO — depend on abstraction
class OrderService {
  constructor(private readonly repo: IOrderRepository) {}
}

// ❌ DON'T — concrete coupling
class OrderService {
  private repo = new PostgresOrderRepository() // coupled, untestable
}
```

## 3 · Design Patterns Cheat Sheet

Use the **simplest pattern** that solves the problem. Never pattern-for-pattern's sake.

| Problem | Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Object creation complexity | **Factory / Builder** | Builder when >3 constructor params |
| One instance needed | **Singleton** | Use DI container, not `static getInstance()` |
| Plug-in behavior at runtime | **Strategy** | Replace switch/if chains |
| Decouple emitter ↔ listener | **Observer / EventEmitter** | Keep payloads typed |
| Wrap without subclassing | **Decorator** | Logging, caching, auth guards |
| Simplify a subsystem | **Facade** | SDK wrappers, third-party libs |
| Expensive object reuse | **Object Pool** | DB connections, workers |
| UI state across components | **Context + Reducer** | Avoid prop drilling >2 levels |
| Async flow control | **Pipeline / Chain of Responsibility** | Middleware stacks |
| Conditional rendering variants | **Compound Components** | Flexible, composable UIs |

## 4 · DRY Principles — Practical Checklist

```
□ Function appears >1 time → extract it
□ Logic duplicated across files → move to shared util/hook/service
□ Same query written twice → make a composable query factory
□ Same UI block in 2+ components → make a component
□ Same validation rule in 2+ places → move to shared schema (Zod/Yup)
□ Same error message string → constants file
□ Same CSS pattern in 3+ places → utility class or token
```

**Abstraction threshold: 3.** Duplicate once = acceptable. Twice = extract.

## 5 · Folder Structure (Fullstack)

```
src/
  config/           ← constants, env, routes, theme
  types/            ← shared TypeScript types/interfaces
  lib/              ← third-party wrappers (axios instance, db client)
  modules/          ← feature-sliced (each module = self-contained)
    [feature]/
      api.ts        ← data fetching
      hooks.ts      ← React hooks
      store.ts      ← state (Zustand/Redux slice)
      components/   ← UI
      utils.ts      ← pure functions
      types.ts      ← local types
      index.ts      ← public API (barrel export)
  components/       ← shared/global UI primitives
  hooks/            ← shared hooks
  utils/            ← shared pure functions
  services/         ← external service integrations
  middleware/       ← server middleware
  pages/ (or app/)  ← routing layer only — no business logic
```

**Rule:** Import across modules only through `index.ts` barrel. Internal paths stay internal.

## 6 · Code Quality Rules

### Functions
- Max 20 lines. If longer → decompose.
- Max 3 parameters. Beyond 3 → use an options object.
- Pure by default. Side effects are explicit and isolated.
- Named functions > anonymous lambdas for stack trace clarity.

### Naming
```
Variables:   noun          → userList, isLoading, totalAmount
Functions:   verb + noun   → fetchUser, parseDate, validateEmail
Booleans:    is/has/can    → isActive, hasPermission, canEdit
Constants:   UPPER_SNAKE   → MAX_RETRY_COUNT, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
Types/I/F:   PascalCase    → UserProfile, IOrderRepository
```

### Comments
- Comment **why**, not **what**. Code shows what; comments explain intent.
- No commented-out code in commits. Use `git` for history.

### Error Handling
- Fail fast and loudly at boundaries (API input, env vars, config).
- Use typed error classes — never throw raw strings.
- Every `async` function either returns a `Result<T, E>` type or has a try/catch at call site.

## 7 · Component Architecture (Frontend)

```
Page           → orchestrates, no UI logic
  ↓
Feature        → business-aware, owns data fetching & state
  ↓
UI Component   → pure, presentational, prop-driven
  ↓
Primitive      → atomic (Button, Input, Icon) — zero business logic
```

**Rules:**
- Props interface for every component — no implicit `any`.
- Default props via destructuring, not `defaultProps`.
- Memoize only after profiling. Premature `memo` is noise.
- Co-locate: test + story + component in same folder.

---

## 8 · API Design Rules

- RESTful by default. GraphQL only when justified (complex graph, multi-consumer).
- Consistent response envelope:
  ```ts
  { data: T | null, error: ApiError | null, meta?: PaginationMeta }
  ```
- Versioning via URL prefix: `/api/v1/...`
- Validate input at the boundary with schema (Zod). Never trust client data.
- HTTP status codes semantically correct — `422` for validation, `409` for conflict, `404` for missing.
- Pagination always for list endpoints. No unbounded queries.

---

## 9 · State Management Decision Tree

```
Is it server data? (async, cached)
  → YES → React Query / SWR / RTK Query
  → NO  → Is it shared across many components?
            → YES → Zustand store / Redux slice
            → NO  → Is it only UI state?
                      → YES → useState / useReducer
                      → NO  → URL state (useSearchParams)
```

## 10 · Testing Strategy

| Layer | Tool | Coverage Target |
|---|---|---|
| Pure utils/logic | Vitest/Jest | 100% |
| Hooks | Testing Library | Key paths |
| Components | Testing Library | Behavior, not markup |
| API routes | Supertest | Happy + error paths |
| E2E critical flows | Playwright | Top 5 user journeys |

**Philosophy:**
- Test behavior, not implementation.
- One assertion per test concept.
- Arrange → Act → Assert. Always.
- Mock at the boundary (network, DB) — not deep inside business logic.

---

## 11 · Performance Defaults

- Images: lazy-load, explicit `width`/`height`, modern format (WebP/AVIF).
- Fonts: `font-display: swap`, preload critical fonts.
- JS: code-split at route level by default.
- DB queries: always paginate, always select only needed columns, explain heavy queries.
- Caching: HTTP Cache-Control headers on all static/semi-static responses.
- Never block the main thread: heavy compute → Web Worker or server-side.

---

## 12 · Security Baseline

```
□ All user input sanitized/validated server-side
□ No secrets in client bundle or logs
□ Parameterized queries only — zero string interpolation in SQL
□ CSP headers set
□ Auth tokens in httpOnly cookies, not localStorage
□ Rate limiting on auth + mutation endpoints
□ Dependencies audited: `npm audit` / `pnpm audit` in CI
```

## 13 · Git & PR Discipline

**Commit format (Conventional Commits):**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

feat(auth): add OAuth2 Google login
fix(cart): correct subtotal with discount
refactor(api): extract pagination util
```

**PR rules:**
- One concern per PR. Mix of feat + refactor = split it.
- PR description: What + Why + How to test. Nothing else.
- Self-review before requesting review. No WIP PRs to main.

## 14 · Agent Behavior Directives

When generating code, the agent **MUST**:

1. **Reuse before creating** — check existing utils, hooks, constants first.
2. **Output minimal diffs** — show only what changes, use `// ... unchanged`.
3. **Extract shared values** — any repeated literal goes to `config/constants.ts`.
4. **Apply the right pattern** — don't force patterns; solve the actual problem.
5. **Type everything** — no `any`. Use `unknown` + narrowing when type is genuinely unknown.
6. **Validate at boundaries** — never assume data shape from external sources.
7. **Keep components dumb** — lift state/logic up or into hooks/services.
8. **One abstraction per decision** — don't stack patterns without reason.

When writing explanations, the agent **MUST**:

1. State conclusion first, rationale after.
2. Use code examples over prose when showing technical concepts.
3. Maximum 3 bullet points per concept. More = rewrite as prose.
4. Skip obvious steps. Assume the reader can code.
